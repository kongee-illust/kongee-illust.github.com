                            <p>For the final prokect, I will be iterating further on project 2 - Every Picture, exploring the user experience brought by microinteractions and emotional design, specifically the delight factor.</p>

                            <p><b>Comparison Project 1 - StudioChevojon</b></p>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="images/ref1.svg" alt="ref1">
                                <figcaption><em><a href="https://studiochevojon.com/">StudioChevojon</a></em></figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>This <a href="https://studiochevojon.com/">website</a> is an editorial-style website, showcasing many images of varying subjects. I chose this website because it serves a similar purpose as my project 2, which is to display
                                pictures in an interesting way, along with a small amount of text. The website lagged a little on my screen, presumably because of how big the images are. Though they add to the immersive nature of the website, I think
                                it would be better to size down for the sake of user experience. However, the continuous horizontal scroll, brutalist typography, as well as the randomized position of the images make the user experience more interesting,
                                and works well for the editorial, magazine-style nature of the website.</p>

                            <p><b>Comparison Project 2 - Giulia Tonon</b></p>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="images/ref2.svg" alt="ref2">
                                <figcaption><em><a href="https://www.giuliatonon.it/">Giulia Tonon</a></em></figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>I chose Giulia Tonon's <a href="https://www.giuliatonon.it/">portfolio website</a> as the second comparison project. Serving as a viewport for all of their work, Tonon's website displays a various selection of her work through
                                opposing scrolls. Like the first website, this website lagged a lot on my computer due to the quantity and the large size of the images. However, the hover interaction of the mouse and the inverted color difference from
                                the mouse made the website navigation enjoyable. Also, the images zoomed out upon hovering, which was a nice way to distinguish the selected image apart from others. The changing UI at each breakpoint of the website viewport
                                was nicely connected, as well.</p>

                            <p><b>Project Goals</b></p>
                            <p>Through iterating further on this project, I want to enhance my knowledge in JavaScript. Though this may sound obvious, this goal means a lot to me, as I've been learning so many concepts that I would like to retain for future
                                projects. I want to take this final as an opportunity to revisit concepts learned throughout the quarter. My final project is similar to the two comparison projects in that they're all experimental methods of displaying
                                images in an interesting way, but different in that my project prioritizes user experience over aesthetics.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Design Strategies</b></p>
                            <p>In terms of design, I am excited to practice curating the user experience to be inclusive and accessible, while designing the UI to be delightful and enjoyable. I plan on focusing on minimalism, as I have with the first iteration
                                of studio 2 and my two comparison projects. I want to focus on an "less is more" mindset through simple geometrical elements and an off-black-and-white color palette.</p>

                            <p><b>Interaction Strategies</b></p>
                            <p>I want to include many behaviors triggered by user input and action, such as moving geometrical elements, hover animations, and more. The website will be seemingly simple and minimal, but will be enriched with microinteractions
                                such as these. They don't have to be noticeable right away, so that the delight factor is accentuated.</p>

                            <p><b>Experience Goals</b></p>
                            <p>I want to combine all the ideas that I have proposed above to make a curated experience for my users. Whether it be navigating through the interactions on the website, reading short stories that make up my small, yet definite
                                happiness (소확행), or viewing the pictures organized in a scroll viewport, the user will be entertained and encouraged to keep navigating.</p>
