                            <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                            <p>With the progress that I made on the design and code, I had a chance to run usability testing with three of my classmates. With fresh sets of eyes looking at my project, I was able to learn so much about my design that I wouldn't
                                have been able to figure out by myself.</p>

                            <p><b>Significant Observations</b></p>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="images/grace.svg" alt="grace">
                                <figcaption><em>User Tester 1: Grace Bui</em></figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>Oftentimes, designers learn a lot more about their products during usability testing than they do while they design by themselves. This was the case for me as well, because I stared at my project so long that I subconsciously
                                overrode lots of usability issues that my website actually had.</p>
                            <p>When I was observing my users that navigated through my website, I noticed that all my users <b>clicked on the "up" arrow first</b> instead of the "down" arrow. This was interesting, as I would always use the "down" arrow first.
                                From this observation and a conversation with Glenda, I decided to get rid of the "up" arrow on the first image, and the "down" arrow on the last image.</p>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="images/michelle2.svg" alt="michelle2">
                                <figcaption><em>User Tester 2: Michelle McKenzie</em></figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>Another observation that I thought was interesting was my users' tendency to scroll more, rather than using the arrows. This was interesting, yet expected, since users will intuitively use the scroll when they see a scrollable
                                element. From this observation, I decided to have the arrow buttons visible <b>only after the user opens an image</b>, so that they can use the arrows to navigate from one image to another with the descriptions changing
                                dynamically.
                            </p>

                            <figure>
                                <img src="images/michelle1.svg" alt="michelle1">
                                <figcaption><em>A closer look at the testing screen</em></figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>Last significant observation that I noticed was that my user testers expected there to be a click event on the main title and description on the left. I projected that this may have been caused by the cursor change issue that
                                I have been having. With the help of Divjeet during the remainder of the class, I was able to fix it, thus ridding this problem. For the final draft, I should aim on removing any other confusion that could be caused by
                                the custom cursors.</p>

                            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                            <p>From the usability testing today, I realized that websites, regardless of how nice the design is, cannot be great unless it's usable. I found out that my website had lots of usability issues today through my peers' helpful
                                feedbacks. For the final iteration of the final project, I will make sure that my website will be intuitive enough so that the user experience is great, just like the design.</p>
