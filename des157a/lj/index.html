                        <p>In "Best Practices for Form Design," author Salim Ansari discusses ways to improve the usability of forms. From minimizing input fields to following key principles for the website's accessibility, these tips ultimately contribute
                            toward making any forms practical, relevant, and pleasant for the user.</p>
                        <p>In particular, Ansari emphasizes the importance of keeping a minimal number of columns for the layout of forms. I thought it was interesting how there is a "vertical momentum" of the users. When we consume any media, such as books,
                            the vertical momentum of reading down the page is disturbed when we have to move our eyes to the top of the adjacent page. Though it is incredibly impractical to create a long, horizontal scroll to replace a standard book,
                            we must take advantage of the tangible user interface that allows us to have a long "column" inside a container, which is our display screen.</p>
                        <p>I was also surprised that inline labels have a critical drawback, which is that the user cannot see the label unless the text box is empty. Having seen many forms in the past with this practice, I then remembered the times when
                            I had to perform the same exact action, and how inconvenient it was! Now, I know not to design forms with inline labels for my upcoming project.</p>
                        <p>Overall, this article left me with a reminder to design for the users' experience, not for my convenience. Oftentimes, I make the mistake of designing elements that are convenient for me, without considering my target audience
                            and users. Now, I know to design with these key principles in mind for my next project.</p>
