    <p><b>Prompt</b>: Create a guessing number game where the user inputs a number between 1 and 10. Then guess the user input by generating a random number between 1 and 10. Keep guessing until the user says it's correct. At the end of the game it will
        tell the user thanks for playing and a tells the user to treat themselves with a randomly generated food from the array list. (Credit: Lim Sung)
