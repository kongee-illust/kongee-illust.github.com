                    <p>Through this assignment, I conducted usability testing with my project in progress, which showed the basic flow of the website as well as some functionality through JavaScript, such as the expandable hamburger menu. With three testers
                        — Ama, Darren, and Alvin — I was able to take this opportunity to gather ideas to improve my final project.</p>

                    <h1 id="card-title">findings & thoughts</h1>
                    <p><b>Redirect page for the form.</b> I discovered the importance of a redirect button through usability testing. The testers all displayed confusion after submitting their stories to the Google Form, and expressed their wishes for a
                        redirect button or for the form to open in a new tab.<br>
                        <b>Description for the form.</b> Some of my users wanted to revisit the purpose of the form, and were confused about what to write about in the response section. In the post-test interview, they “wished there would be a descriptor
                        that summarizes the project.”<br>
                        <b>CTA elements.</b> One user in particular kept clicking on the down arrow on the landing page expecting to be led to the next section. Also, the clicks sometimes did not register due to their small hitbox.</p>

                    <p>These findings were extremely helpful for me to figure out whether the website’s flow was intuitive. Since my main goal for this project was to have the user experience be of utmost importance, I will incorporate my findings to the
                        final development by modifying the Google Form and editing the interactivity of the CTA buttons.</p>
