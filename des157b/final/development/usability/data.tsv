I didn't go to Chinatown that often, but on the rare occasion that I did, we almost always stopped by a bakery. As soon as you stepped through the doorway, the delicious smell of fresh baked goods would immediately hit you and make you salivate. I was always so excited to take my picks amongst the variety of buns and pastries showcased in trays and glass displays. Afterwards, my mom would scold me and tell me to stop dropping crumbs everywhere as I absolutely destroyed the treats in the car.
