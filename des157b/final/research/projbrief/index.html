                <h1 id="card-title">summary</h1>
                <p>My project focuses on shining a light on the diversity of the Asian & Asian American student body at UCD through shared stories of culture, practices, and unique backgrounds through food, a love language for many households that carry
                    heartwarming stories.</p>

            <div class="items">
                <h1 id="card-title">project goals</h1>
                <p>Through my project, I hope to generate a sense of solidarity among the Asian & Asian American students at UCD, provide an opportunity for them to recount on nostalgic memories, and reinforce their identity through storytelling.</p>

                <h1 id="card-title">design strategies</h1>
                <p>To draw the most focus on the actual content of the website, I plan on having an overall minimalistic design accompanied by one or two highlight colors for information hierarchy. For this purpose of effective information display, I plan
                    on coming up with a design guidelines page to ensure consistency across all screens in this project.</p>

                <h1 id="card-title">interaction strategies</h1>
                <p>As stated above, my biggest goal for effective UX in this project is to minimize unnecessary elements that may distract the user from the actual content. However, given that interactions are indispensable in a smooth user experience, some
                    interactions I’m thinking of are hover animations inspired by my competitive analysis, loading animations, and smooth scroll functions.</p>

                <h1 id="card-title">experience goals</h1>
                <p>Through the strategies outlined above, I hope my project, its function, and contents help the Asian & Asian American community remind themselves of their roots, while celebrating the diversity and unique stories from each other. I hope
                    to have the navigation experience feel as if the user is reading various stories!</p>
