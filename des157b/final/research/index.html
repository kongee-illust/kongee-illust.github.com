            <p id="summary">This article discusses the significance of food in different cultures. The author states that the food we eat in our families become a part of our identity as well as an embodiment of the culture and heritage we come from. According to the
                author, making food from our culture symbolizes pride and celebrates diversity. This is a great article for me to research to figure out the KPI for this project, which is a majority of the users feeling proud of their culture and family
                and learning about others’ culture through the communal posts.</p>

                that people can empathize with. As it helped me empathize with people in my community and helped me think of my own, this article is useful in helping me establish the importance of storytelling in our community.</p>
